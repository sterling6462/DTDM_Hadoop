Process process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("cmd /c dir C:\\Users\\mkyong");
On the successful completion of a job, the MapReduce runtime creates a _SUCCESS file in the output directory. This may be useful for applications that need to see if a result set is complete just by inspecting HDFS.

The output files are by default named as part-x-yyyyy
where:
1) x iseither 'm' or 'r', depending on whether the job was a map only job, or reduce
2)yyyyy is the Mapper, or Reducer task number (zero based)

So if a job which has 10 reducers, files generated will have named part-r-00000 to part-r-00009, one for each reducer task.

It is possible to change the default name.

Configuration conf = new Configuration();

FileSystem fs = FileSystem.get(conf);

if(fs.exists(new Path(args[1])))

{

fs.delete(new Path(args[1]),true);

}

----------------------

Path output = new Path("/the/folder/to/delete");
FileSystem hdfs = FileSystem.get(URI.create("hdfs://namenode:port"),conf);

// delete existing directory
if (hdfs.exists(output)) {
    hdfs.delete(output, true);
}
------------------------

FileSystem fs = FileSystem.get(getConf());
fs.delete(new Path("path/to/file"), true);
